This Intro to Algorithms lab implements three different algorithms for simple multiplication of two integers using only addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations. The first implementation is the simple gradeschool method that consists of carrying bits and adding to find the final result. The second implementation is a simple recursive algorithm. The third implementation is Gauss' divide and conquer algorithm. The program takes as input the number of digits, creates random numbers, and then runs these algorithms multiple times to find the average runtime of each.
