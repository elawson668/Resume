This program parses through a .txt file containing a genome sequence, in order to perform operations on it. The genome command will create a string from a given text file. The kmer command will set the kmer size, or the size of the substrings possible in the genome. The query command will take as input a genome substring and max number of mismatches, and the program will print out all of the matches it finds. The program utilises a C++ map data structure to keep track of the kmers.
