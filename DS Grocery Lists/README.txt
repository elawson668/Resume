This program is a good example of object oriented programming. It maintains a kitchen with ingredients and recipes, and can accept commands to create new recipes, add ingredients, print recipes, make recipes, print the contents of the kitchen, and suggest recipes that can be made with the ingredients possessed. The kitchen, recipe, and ingredient are all separate objects that interact with each other to perform various operations.
